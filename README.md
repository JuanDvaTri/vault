Hello! This is my repository. The purpose of it is to document my journey through the various concepts in Cybersecurity.
I am excited to dive in.

This line is included through VS Code connected to my github repository.

New Knowledge:
 - I know how to create a repository
 - I know how to create pull requests and branches
 - I understand the above concepts

I am actively experimenting with VS Code and github.

Issues:
 - I can't figure out how to use git in VS Code

 I am using the github desktop app. I don't really know how to type inside of this file there, so I am opening it through vs code instead. I will not think about it too much right now.
