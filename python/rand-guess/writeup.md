# Random Number Guesser Game  
### by Juan Rodriguez

The purpose of this short simple little program is just to familiarize myself with booleans, functions, etc. This program was super quick to put together but I still succesfully understood what I was doing, learned a few new things as well.

## What I learned
- How to use functions in Python
- That's it really, Python just feels like simpler Java, haha

## How I could improve
- I think my program is very decent. I can't currently think of ways to improve on such a simple program.

Either way, I am satisfied that this very simple program succesfully works. My next project will be something similar, but the system will instead guide you to the correct number.
