I am trying to follow along with Marco Bonzanini's guide on mining twitter/X data with Python.  
The purpose of this is to help with my understanding of the language. I believe project based learning is the best way to learn. For the purpose of this writeup I will be referring to it as Twitter.  


1. I registered an application with Twitter, and installed tweepy on my system. It is a python library that easily interacts with Twitter's API.  

2.Alright I wrote the connection thing that connects to the API for twitter.  

3. i wrote the program and found out i needed to pay money to use certain features with Twitter's API
